## Description

Enclosed in this repository is the code and the project documents we will be using for this project. The responsibilities of our working group include:

1. Audit the codebase and add inline comments ([Javadoc](https://www.baeldung.com/javadoc) or otherwise)

   Fork this repository to your account, add your comments, then commit, push, and create a pull request from your fork to this repository. See [this link detailing the process](https://reflectoring.io/github-fork-and-pull/)

2. Provide the benchmarking working group with actionable insights for standing up a lab environment

3. Create a user guide document describing the process for running the lab environment (see sample document [here](Part1-UserGuide - Sample.pdf))

4. Assemble the final deliverable as a .zip archive, due Mon 02/13 at 11:59pm

# TODO

- [ ] Each member of the documentation report working group must make a fork, add comments, and create a pull request
- [ ] make TCPClient and TCPServer send and receive binary data
- [ ] parameterize IP and ports for all programs (make it not hardcoded - default values are ok)
- [ ] After doing a close reading of the code, estimate the results of the lab benchmarking and begin to stub out a report and user guide (use [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GBz-MCbro0JrvfaEXTlpnCDcOlLi4INHzIb_OOtZvw8/edit?usp=sharing))
